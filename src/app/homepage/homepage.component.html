      <h3>Zachary Mohler portfolio website</h3>
      <p>I created this website from scratch to use as a portfolio item, as well as to manage my collections.</p>
      <p>I am a graduate of Southern New Hampshire University with a (summa cum laude) degree in Computer Science with an emphasis on Software Engineering.</p>
      <b>This website utilizes the MEAN stack</b>
      <p>The meat and potatoes of the site is built in Angular.</p>
      <p>Behind the scenes, there is another app running a RESTful API to handle communications between the site and the database--which is a MongoDB database hosted on CleverCloud.</p>
      <p>To access this Angular app's source, follow this link to where it's hosted on GitHub</p>

      <h3>More about the site...</h3>
      <p>This page contains info about the site and some info about me, hence its name "about me".</p>
      <p>The collections page is where the database management part of things comes in. Following the "collections" link in the menu will take you to a list of my collections, you can view them by format or just view the whole collection. The collection itself is a MongoDB database, and the data is retrieved using the API.</p>

      <h3>Even more about me...</h3>
      <p>This website is inspired by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110614213607/http://cinemassacre.com/" target="blank">original cinemassacre</a> website before it was updated to its inferior modern state.</p>
      <p>James Rolfe, the mind behind cinemassacre, has had a very big impact on my life--particularly in the development of my collecting habit.</p>
      <p>Not long after my discovery of cinemassacre content on YouTube, I happened to be in a thrift store and found an NES. The rest is history. As my humble video game collection grew, so did I.</p>
      <p>I began to watch more of the cinemassacre.com content aside from just the Angry Video Game Nerd videos I found on YouTube. Videos such as "the dragon in my dreams" and "cinemassacre 200". This is when I began to have a deeper love for film, and thus began collecting movies across all platforms.</p>
      <p>My collecting of music was more due to my newfound proclivity for collecting that evolved into buying music on as many formats as possible. The same is the case for the collecting of books.</p>


      <h6>Why do I collect?</h6>
      <p>I mostly collect for the fun of the hunt. Rarely will I buy collection item online (aside from new records), most of my collecting is done in thrift stores and antique stores.</p>
      <p>Another reason I collect is to have something tangible to hold onto. I really don't subscribe to the idea that you can <i>own</i> something in a cloud somewhere. So when I say "yeah I have that movie" I want to be able to hold it up and show it off!</p>
      <p>This all comes from the idea that if the internet goes out or becomes unavailable for the foreseeable future, I can still enjoy my movies, music, and games! Particularly my record collection, because those puppies will survive thousands of years versus CDs, DVDs, and tape only lasting a few hundred.</p>
      <p>Which is why I love vinyl (and in some cases shellac) as a format for music--it's figuratively everlasting, and technically doesn't require any electricity to work! Acoustic means of amplification of those tiny vibrations would work too, as was the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lNlWLIghJs" target="blank">method of music in the home 100 years ago.</a>
